/// Simulate a SMP system with ``n`` CPUs initially present on
/// the machine type board. On boards supporting CPU hotplug, the optional
/// ``maxcpus`` parameter can be set to enable further CPUs to be
/// added at runtime. When both parameters are omitted, the maximum number
/// of CPUs will be calculated from the provided topology members and the
/// initial CPU count will match the maximum number. When only one of them
/// is given then the omitted one will be set to its counterpart's value.
/// Both parameters may be specified, but the maximum number of CPUs must
/// be equal to or greater than the initial CPU count. Product of the
/// CPU topology hierarchy must be equal to the maximum number of CPUs.
/// Both parameters are subject to an upper limit that is determined by
/// the specific machine type chosen.
///
/// To control reporting of CPU topology information, values of the topology
/// parameters can be specified. Machines may only support a subset of the
/// parameters and different machines may have different subsets supported
/// which vary depending on capacity of the corresponding CPU targets. So
/// for a particular machine type board, an expected topology hierarchy can
/// be defined through the supported sub-option. Unsupported parameters can
/// also be provided in addition to the sub-option, but their values must be
/// set as 1 in the purpose of correct parsing.
///
/// Either the initial CPU count, or at least one of the topology parameters
/// must be specified. The specified parameters must be greater than zero,
/// explicit configuration like "cpus=0" is not allowed. Values for any
/// omitted parameters will be computed from those which are given.
///
/// For example, the following sub-option defines a CPU topology hierarchy
/// (2 sockets totally on the machine, 2 cores per socket, 2 threads per
/// core) for a machine that only supports sockets/cores/threads.
/// Some members of the option can be omitted but their values will be
/// automatically computed:
